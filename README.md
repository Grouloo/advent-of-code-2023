# advent-of-code-2023

## Description

My participation to the [Advent of Code 2023 event](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Stack

To solve the puzzles, I use:

- **TypeScript**
- **Bun**, to run the solutions
- **Bun-Test**, to run the examples and some other test cases
- **shulk**, an open-source package of my own. [More here](https://github.com/Grouloo/shulk)

## Use this repo

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run a puzzle:

```bash
bun run ./src/[day]/index.ts
```

To run the tests:

```bash
bun test
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.14. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
